Coding Challenge Planning and Notes

Focus on the Must Haves, then selectivly go through Nice to Haves.

Must Haves:
- API interaction
-- Fetch by Meal Category (Desserts)
-- Fetch by Meal ID
- minimalistic but functional UI/UX

Nice to Haves:
- Error Handling
- Documentation Hosting
- Unit Testing
- Persistency


Notes:
CoreData vs User Defaults?
Sort using NSDescriptor vs filter and other functions?
